    <!-- Case : 1 : Description : It will download first html file then fetch then style then script and then again excutes parsing html
     in this case style and script loading will block parsing of html this leads error on button click events of script because buttons html are not ready -->

    <!-- Case : 2 : With defer -->
    <!-- <script src="defer-async-index.js"></script> -->
    <!-- Case : 2 : Description : It will download first html file then fetch then style then script but it will excutes script only after complete parsing of html
     in this case style loading will block parsing of html but script will not block parsing of html because script will excutes after complete parsing of html so no error on button click events of script because buttons html are ready -->

    <!-- Case : 3 : With async -->
    <!-- <script src="defer-async-index.js"></script> -->
    <!-- Case : 3 : Description : It will download first html file then fetch then style then script but it will excutes script as soon as it is downloaded without waiting for complete parsing of html
     in this case style loading will block parsing of html but script will not block parsing of html because script will excutes as soon as it is downloaded
     Sometimes there are some script that not depend on html code this standalone scripts we can load earlier
     async tells browser to load scripts as earlier as possible -->

    <script> <!-- here defer / async does not block HTML parsing it is part of html parsing -->
